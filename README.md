# pogo-vue

This repository holds the source code for the new Vue.js-based webapps for Pogo's frontend. It's divided into two directories.

 - `admin/` is the where the admin interface is, ported from the DeV interface in the main Pogo repository.

 - `main/` is the client frontend for perusing the feed and listening to episodes.

 If on Windows, you can run `build.bat` to automagically build and aggregate the files into `dist\` in the root.
